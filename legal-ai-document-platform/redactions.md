# Redactions & Sanitization

This document explains what information was changed or removed from the original project to create this public case study.

---

## User & Case Data

**Removed:**
- Actual user accounts and demographics
- Real case details and outcomes
- Specific plaintiff/defendant names
- Court case numbers and documents
- User-submitted evidence photos
- Settlement amounts and negotiations

**Sanitized to:**
- Generic "self-represented litigants" descriptions
- Conceptual case types without identifying details
- Time-based metrics (e.g., "5 minutes") without volume
- Feature descriptions without usage statistics

**Why:** Protects user privacy and attorney-client privilege considerations.

---

## Legal Content & Templates

**Changed:**
- Specific document templates → Generic "court-compliant format" descriptions
- Proprietary legal language → Standard legal concepts
- Custom affirmative defense logic → General defense categories
- Exact statute citations → Representative examples
- Settlement calculation formulas → High-level approach descriptions

**Kept:**
- General legal areas (eviction, employment)
- Publicly available statutes (FL § 83.51, Title VII)
- Known case law (Clark v. Hiett - published opinion)
- Court formatting requirements (public rules)

**Why:** Protects proprietary legal templates while sharing architectural approach.

---

## AI Integration Details

**Removed:**
- Specific OpenAI model versions and parameters
- Custom prompt engineering techniques
- Exact entity extraction patterns
- Confidence threshold values
- Training data or fine-tuning details
- API usage costs and limits

**Generalized:**
- "OpenAI GPT-4" instead of specific model deployment
- "Entity recognition" instead of exact regex/ML patterns
- "Confidence scoring" instead of specific algorithms
- "Custom prompts" instead of actual prompt text

**Why:** Protects proprietary AI implementation while demonstrating capability.

---

## Business & Metrics

**Removed:**
- Exact user counts and growth rates
- Revenue numbers and pricing models
- Conversion rates and engagement metrics
- Geographic distribution beyond state level
- Partner organizations and referral sources
- Marketing performance data

**Changed to:**
- Percentage-based descriptions (e.g., "50%+ mobile users")
- Relative metrics (e.g., "reduced time from X to Y")
- Feature availability without usage statistics
- General impact statements

**Why:** Protects business sensitive information while demonstrating outcomes.

---

## Technical Infrastructure

**Removed:**
- Hosting provider details and configuration
- Database schema and table structures
- API endpoint URLs and routes
- Authentication token formats
- File storage bucket names and paths
- Third-party service API keys

**Generalized:**
- "Next.js frontend" without deployment specifics
- "PostgreSQL database" without schema details
- "Encrypted file storage" without provider
- "Queue-based processing" without queue system details

**Why:** Prevents infrastructure reconnaissance while sharing architectural patterns.

---

## Integration Partners

**Removed:**
- Specific legal research platform integrations
- Document signing service details
- Payment processor specifics
- SMS/email provider configuration
- Court e-filing system APIs
- Legal aid organization partnerships

**Generalized:**
- "Court-compliant formatting" without e-filing details
- "Multi-channel alerts" without SMS provider
- "Electronic signatures" without vendor
- "Attorney consultation pathway" without referral network

**Why:** Protects partner relationships and integration details.

---

## Compliance & Legal

**Removed:**
- Specific bar association opinions or guidance
- Legal review documentation
- Terms of service and disclaimers
- Privacy policy specifics
- Insurance and liability coverage
- Jurisdiction-specific legal advice

**Kept:**
- General ethical principles (not practice of law)
- Standard compliance frameworks (GDPR, accessibility)
- Public legal standards (court formatting rules)
- Industry best practices (legal disclaimers)

**Why:** Protects legal compliance strategy while demonstrating responsible design.

---

## Geographic & Jurisdictional Details

**Changed:**
- Specific court locations → "court location finder"
- Exact county/district rules → General Florida eviction procedures
- Local legal aid contacts → "emergency assistance program connections"
- Court-specific filing procedures → Generic filing instructions

**Kept:**
- State-level examples (Florida eviction, federal EEOC)
- Publicly available procedural rules
- General timeline requirements (5 business days)
- Public statute references

**Why:** Shares architectural approach without becoming jurisdiction-specific legal resource.

---

## Code & Algorithms

**Removed:**
- Source code implementation
- Database queries and schemas
- Validation logic and business rules
- Settlement calculation exact formulas
- Deadline calculation algorithms
- Template generation code

**Generalized:**
- "Smart questionnaire logic" without actual code
- "Damage calculators" without formulas
- "Validation rules" without specifics
- "Template system" without implementation

**Why:** Protects intellectual property while demonstrating technical capabilities.

---

## What Remains Authentic

Despite redactions, this case study accurately represents:

✅ **Real architectural patterns**
- Document upload → AI analysis → questionnaire → generation pipeline
- Entity extraction from legal documents
- Court-compliant template system

✅ **Actual features delivered**
- Eviction defense document automation
- Employment law EEOC form generation
- Deadline tracking and alerts
- Settlement calculation tools

✅ **Genuine technical challenges solved**
- AI integration for legal document analysis
- Multi-jurisdiction template management
- Mobile-responsive accessible design
- Deadline extraction and calculation

✅ **Production-proven technology choices**
- Next.js for frontend responsiveness
- AI for document intelligence
- Queue-based background processing
- Encrypted file storage

---

## Verification

While specific templates and user data are redacted, the architectural approaches, technical solutions, and feature descriptions are genuine and reflect a production legal technology platform.

**This case study demonstrates real-world legal AI experience through:**
- Discussion of document intelligence pipelines
- Court formatting and citation requirements
- Deadline management for legal timelines
- Ethical considerations in legal tech (unauthorized practice of law prevention)

**The platform described successfully generates court-compliant legal documents for self-represented litigants while maintaining appropriate disclaimers and ethical boundaries.**
